      <h1>the unseen experiment</h1>
      <p>It was a dark night, but I didn’t care too much the dim candle radiated enough light for me to see when he was going to get here. Finally the wizard arrived carrying a small bag with him. 
“Double lock my friend so glad you showed up! Not to mention you are early.” The wizard looked slightly nervous.
“Either that or you are late.” The wizard ignored the comment and continued walking until we were side by side. “So what brings you here wizard.”
The wizard replied in a quiet voice. So quiet I barely heard it. “I have come to reclaim that favor from you.” I looked at him with cold eyes. I knew what favor he was talking about but I told him I quit that a long time ago. And the wizard replied as if reading my mind. “I know how much you hate this, but the person has become corrupt. There is nothing we can do my friend. We both know why you stayed here. You need to keep an eye on him. Well finish him off and then leave.”
I hated agreeing to that wizard even now I hate it. But as a former rogue this was the best job for me. After about an hour next thing I knew I was waiting in the garden waiting for the perfect time. As the guards took their station under me I dropped without a sound and took two down. I only hoped it was painless. I quickly picked the lock before anyone even realized I was there. There he was. The mayor of this place in his bed sleeping soundly while everyone dies around him. Not a care in the world. Well at least he will be in the place where he does care. Normally this is the part where I would say I pitied the man. In truth I hated his gut. He killed most of my crew now all that is left is me and blood wolf. With a quick slice he was gone. Life is a fragile thing. I took a few treasures as I was leaving but besides that no one knew I was there. Gone with the next wind. There are rumors of an unseen force killing people. I have become a nightmare to small children and I can't even say that I care.
