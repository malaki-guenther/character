      <h5>By:Mark Jarnigan, Malaki guenther</h5>
      <p>Luckie was a normal powerful Cleric.He was the average hero,good guy,defender against evil, and so on.Luckie went out of the city of Thorinsburge to go deal with a goblin problem.Which he obviously dealt with.On his journey back Luckie stumbled upon a strange relic.Luckie marveled at it,studying it,drawing it in his journal,and trying to see if it worked correctly.The relic made a SCREEE noise as Luckie used his thunder magic to shock the relic.Luckie’s ears felt like they were being branded from the inside of his eardrums.The relic started floating and spinning up in the air as Luckie fell to his knees,He looked at his hands turning into wind. It looked almost as if he was fading from existence.He was breathing in quickly in a panic. He didn't know what was happening to him.His armour fell to the ground as he stood up,he looked at himself in his mirror and he couldn’t see himself. And behind him stood a young man. This young man was unknown to the cleric.</p>
      <p>The young man smiled like the devil “hello there mister~” his voice was slick and youthful.Luckie wondered who he was and how he could see him so he tried speaking.
      </p>
      <p>”w-who are you and how can you sssee me?” His accent was of a snake’s. His voice, whisper a in the wind. </p>
      <p>The young man tilted his head smirking and replied” I’m a wizard so i can do many things and my name is Raistlin good friend”he extended his hand in greeting.</p>
      <p>Luckie out of kind gesture did the same.Before luckie could notice he fell for a trap. Raistlin tricked him, trapping the new wind spirit into a near inescapable cage. Inacable because whenever he touched it it brought all of his waves (winds) down to zero.For years Raistlin used luckie as a lab rat as his little experiment. Raistlin used him for testing certain types of waves. His favorite was interference waves. He also gave lukie a new name. He was called the unseen servant. There were multiple like him but luckie was the best for his experiments.Luckie decided to make a plan to escape from his hell like prison he talked with the others like him (he could not really see them more or less felt them), they wanted a plan like this for so long they couldn’t remember. The others wanted to sacrifice themselves to Luckies cause for a chance to escape this prison. The plan was quite simple. He would throw one of the others at the cage in hopes it would bring both of the waves to zero. Imbolizing the thing keeping them stuck in there. Only a certain wave could do it but they would need two in order to aid the other and make their wave grow. So two of the oldest and strongest experiments chose to sacrifice themselves to the plan. The two neared the Immobilizer the two looked at each other and nodded as they stood in front of the big monstrosity of a machine. They tackled each other fusing they grew and grew . Their energy grew and fused together and there was a spark and they exploded. Eradicating the Immobilizer. Luckie felt himself return to his former glory before he was trapped growing stronger than ever as he rushed towards the new exit. He saw the wizards dead body, burned by the explosion, and shrugged smiling happily as he skipped/hovered outside the exit.</p>
