      <p>Luckie was a normal powerful Cleric.He was the average hero,good guy,defender against evil, and so on.Luckie went out of the city of Thorinsburge to go deal with a goblin problem.Which he obviously dealt with.On his journey back Luckie stumbled upon a strange relic.Luckie marveled at it,studying it,drawing it in his journal,and trying to see if it worked correctly.The relic made a SCREEE noise as Luckie used his thunder magic to shock the relic.Luckie’s ears felt like they were being branded from the inside of his eardrums.The relic started floating and spinning up in the air as Luckie fell to his knees,He looked at his hands turning into wind. It looked almost as if he was fading from existence.He was breathing in quickly in a panic. He didn't know what was happening to him.His armour fell to the ground as he stood up,he looked at himself in his mirror and he couldn’t see himself. And behind him stood a young man. This young man was unknown to the cleric.The young man smiled like the devil “hello there mister~” his voice was slick and youthful.Luckie wondered who he was and how he could see him so he tried speaking.</p>
      <p>”w-who are you and how can you sssee me?” His accent was of a snake’s. His voice, whisper a in the wind. </p>
      <p>hello</p>
